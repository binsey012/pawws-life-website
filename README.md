## 📷 Images

All images are organized in `frontend/assets/images/` by section:

- `global/` — logos, icons, cursor assets
- `hero/` — hero mascot and backgrounds
- `who/` — “Who We Are” illustrations
- `shop/` — product images (mock/demo)
- `league/` — team badges
- `comics/` — comic panels

Swap images by replacing files with the same names, e.g.:

- Logo: `frontend/assets/images/global/logo.png`
- Mascot: `frontend/assets/images/hero/mascot.png`
- Who images: `frontend/assets/images/who/left.png`, `frontend/assets/images/who/right.png`
- Team badges: `frontend/assets/images/league/team-*.png`
- Comic panels: `frontend/assets/images/comics/panel-*.jpg`
- Shop: `frontend/assets/images/shop/*`

Tips
- Prefer `.webp` when possible
- Hero up to ~1600px width; others ~800px
- Use descriptive names for easy maintenance
